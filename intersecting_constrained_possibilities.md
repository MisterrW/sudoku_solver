The problem:

sometimes it is possible to exclude number n in a square s in a row or column r/c, because in a 3X3 which r/c intersects, which does not contain s, the only squares where value can equal n lie in r/c

Breaking it down:

Every r/c passes through three 3x3s

Exclude the 3x3 which s is in

Leaves two 3x3s which may have values definitely in r/c
